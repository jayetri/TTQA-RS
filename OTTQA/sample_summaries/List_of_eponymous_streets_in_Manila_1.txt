Plaza Moriones is a major public square in Tondo , Manila . Unlike other squares in Manila , the plaza is in the shape of a linear park occupying the central median of Moriones Street , starting at the intersection of Moriones and Juan Luna Streets , and ending at the intersection with Santa Maria Street , bisected by Nicolas Zamora Street in the center . It is named after Governor-General Domingo Moriones y Muralla , responsible for the construction of Manila 's sewerage system during his tenure from 1877 to 1881 . Originally an open green field lined with benches in colonial times , today the plaza is paved , with a size of 2,227 square meters ( 23,970 sq ft ) and a capacity of 6,681 persons . Trees and benches line its entire length , and three fountains have been placed throughout the plaza . Flanked by paved roads , the central portion of the plaza resembles 19th century garden design with its plants such as bandera española ( canna ) flowers and palm trees . At the end of the plaza stands the Sigaw ng Tondo , a monument sculpted in 1978 by Eduardo Castrillo in memory of local victims fleeing Japanese forces during the Battle of Manila in 1945 .
