At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney , Australia , Hyman was only expected to contend for silver in women 's 200-meter butterfly on the night of September 20 , 2000 , as Australian Susie O'Neill was expected to repeat her title ( O'Neill had been undefeated in the 200-meter butterfly for the previous 3-4 years ; and was swimming in her home country ) . Hyman was so shocked that she looked at the scoreboard three times just to make sure that she had won .
