The name Piscataway may be derived from the area 's original Native American residents , transplants from near the Piscataqua River defining the coastal border between New Hampshire and Maine , whose name derives from peske ( branch ) and tegwe ( tidal river ) , or alternatively from pisgeu ( meaning dark night ) and awa ( place of ) or from a Lenape language word meaning great deer or from words meaning place of dark night . The area was appropriated in 1666 by Quakers and Baptists who had left the Puritan colony in New Hampshire . Piscataway Township was formed on December 18 , 1666 , and officially incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21 , 1798 , as part of the state 's initial group of 104 townships . The community , the fifth-oldest municipality in New Jersey , has grown from Native American territory , through a colonial period and is one of the links in the earliest settlement of the Atlantic Ocean seacoast that ultimately led to the formation of the United States . Over the years , portions of Piscataway were taken to form Raritan Township ( March 17 , 1870 , now Edison ) , Dunellen ( October 28 , 1887 ) , Middlesex ( April 9 , 1913 ) and South Plainfield ( March 10 , 1926 ) . Piscataway has advanced educational and research facilities due to the presence of Rutgers University , whose main campus spills into the township .
