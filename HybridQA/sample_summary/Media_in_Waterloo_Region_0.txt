The station was granted a broadcasting license by the CRTC in 2003 , and began broadcasting on February 28 , 2004 . On April 20 , 2005 , the CRTC denied Sound of Faith Broadcasting 's application to change CJTW-FM 's frequency from 94.3 MHz to 106.7 MHz . The licensee also proposed to change the authorized contours by increasing the effective radiated power from 50 watts to 1,585 watts , and the antenna height from 55 to 58 meters . On April 10 , 2006 , Sound of Faith was denied to increase CJTW-FM 's power from 50 watts to 141 watts ( average ) / 250 watts ( maximum ) and increase in antenna height ( at the same location ) from 54 to 58 metres . On February 27 , 2015 , Sound of Faith submitted an application for a new Christian music radio station in Kitchener that would replace CJTW-FM 94.3 , which would operate at 93.7 MHz with an effective radiated power of 420 watts ( non-directional antenna with an effective height of antenna above average terrain of 58 metres ) . Sound of Faith expressed that a new license and frequency is necessary , as they wanted to increase its power and coverage area , but are unable to do so at 94.3 , due to a similar low-powered FM station in Woodstock also broadcasting at 94.3 , CJFH-FM , as well as potential first-adjacent interference issues with Toronto 's CBC Radio 2 outlet , CBL-FM 94.1 . In addition , the Rogers Cable system had since included CJTW-FM on its audio line-up in Kitchener , but as they have picked the station up directly from the airwaves from its master antenna between Kitchener and Woodstock , it often received interference between CJTW-FM and CJFH-FM . The CRTC approved Sound of Faith 's application to operate a new FM station at 93.7 MHz , to replace CJTW-FM 94.3 MHz on September 17 , 2015 .
