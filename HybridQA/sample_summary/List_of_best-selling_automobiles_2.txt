The Volkswagen Type 2 , known officially ( depending on body type ) as the Transporter , Kombi or Microbus , or , informally , as the Bus ( US ) or Camper ( UK ) , Pão de Forma ( Loaf of Bread ) ( Portugal ) is a forward control light commercial vehicle introduced in 1950 by the German automaker Volkswagen as its second car model . Following - and initially deriving from - Volkswagen 's first model , the Type 1 ( Beetle ) , it was given the factory designation Type 2 . As one of the forerunners of the modern cargo and passenger vans , the Type 2 gave rise to forward control competitors in the United States in the 1960s , including the Ford Econoline , the Dodge A100 , and the Chevrolet Corvair 95 Corvan , the latter adapting the rear-engine configuration of the Corvair car in the same manner in which the VW Type 2 adapted the Type 1 layout . European competition included the 1947-1981 Citroën H Van , the 1959-1980 Renault Estafette ( both FF layout ) , and the 1953-1965 FR layout Ford Transit . Japanese manufacturers also introduced similar vehicles , such as the Nissan Caravan , Toyota LiteAce and Subaru Sambar . Like the Beetle , the van has received numerous nicknames worldwide , including the microbus , minibus , and , because of its popularity during the counterculture movement of the 1960s , Hippie van/bus has become its most popular . Brazil contained the last factory in the world that produced the T2 series of Type 2 , which ceased production on 31 December 2013 , due to the introduction of more stringent safety regulations in the country . This ( after the 2002 termination of its T3 successor in South Africa ) marked the end of the era of rear-engine Volkswagens , which originated in 1935 with their Type 1 prototypes .
