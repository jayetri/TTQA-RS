The Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( German : Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) and its variants were the highest awards in the military and paramilitary forces of Nazi Germany during World War II . The Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks , from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry . A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945 . [ Note 1 ] This number is based on the acceptance by the Association of Knight 's Cross Recipients ( AKCR ) . Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht - the Heer ( Army ) , Kriegsmarine ( Navy ) and Luftwaffe ( Air Force ) - as well as the Waffen-SS , the Reich Labour Service and the Volkssturm ( German national militia ) . There were also 43 foreign recipients of the award . These recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel 's book , Die Träger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939-1945 - The Bearers of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939-1945 . Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR . In 1996 a second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients . Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings .
