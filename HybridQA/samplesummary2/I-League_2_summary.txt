During the days of the British Indian Empire , the Kingdom of Manipur was one of the princely states . Between 1917 and 1939 , some people of Manipur pressed the princely rulers for democracy . By the late 1930s , the princely state of Manipur negotiated with the British administration its preference to continue to be part of the Indian Empire , rather than part of Burma , which was being separated from India . These negotiations were cut short with the outbreak of World War II in 1939 . On 11 August 1947 , Maharaja Budhachandra signed an Instrument of Accession , joining India . Later , on 21 September 1949 , he signed a Merger Agreement , merging the kingdom into India , which led to its becoming a Part C State . This merger was later disputed by groups in Manipur , as having been completed without consensus and under duress .
