Text: Final Fight ( Japanese : ファイナルファイト , Hepburn : Fainaru Faito ) is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up video game produced by Capcom . Originally released as an arcade game in 1989 , it was the seventh title released for the CP System hardware . Set in the fictional Metro City , the player controls one of three characters : former pro wrestler and mayor Mike Haggar , his daughter 's boyfriend Cody , and Cody 's best friend Guy , as they set out to defeat the Mad Gear gang and rescue Haggar 's young daughter Jessica . The game began development as a sequel to the original Street Fighter released in 1987 , but the genre was switched from a fighting game to a beat 'em up and the title was changed following the success of Double Dragon . Final Fight was ported to various home consoles such as the Super NES and was followed by a few sequels . Its development team later worked on the original Street Fighter II and some of the characters from Final Fight later appeared as playable fighters in other entries of the franchise such as the Street Fighter Alpha sub-series . In September 13 , 2018 , Capcom announced Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle with Final Fight being one of seven titles and released digitally for PlayStation 4 , Nintendo Switch , Xbox One and Microsoft Windows on September 18 , 2018 .

Capcom Co. , Ltd. ( Japanese : 株式会社カプコン , Hepburn : Kabushiki-gaisha Kapukon ) is a Japanese video game developer and publisher known for creating numerous multi-million selling game franchises , including Mega Man , Street Fighter , Resident Evil , Devil May Cry , Onimusha , Dino Crisis , Dead Rising , Sengoku Basara , Ghosts ' n Goblins , Monster Hunter , Breath of Fire , and Ace Attorney as well as games based on Disney animated properties . Established in 1979 , it has become an international enterprise with subsidiaries in North America , Europe , and Japan .

Beat 'em up ( also known as brawler ) is a video game genre featuring hand-to-hand combat between the protagonist and an improbably large number of opponents . Traditional beat 'em ups take place in scrolling , two-dimensional ( 2D ) levels , though some later games feature more open three-dimensional ( 3D ) environments with yet larger numbers of enemies . These games are noted for their simple gameplay , a source of both critical acclaim and derision . Two-player cooperative gameplay and multiple player characters are also hallmarks of the genre . Most of these games take place in urban settings and feature crime-fighting and revenge-based plots , though some games may employ historical , science fiction or fantasy themes . The first beat 'em up was 1984 's Kung-Fu Master , with 1986 's Renegade introducing the urban settings and underworld revenge themes employed extensively by later games . The genre then saw a period of high popularity between the release of Double Dragon in 1987 , which defined the two-player cooperative mode central to classic beat 'em ups , and led to 1991 's Street Fighter II , which drew gamers towards one-on-one fighting games . Games such as Streets of Rage , Final Fight , Golden Axe and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are other classics to emerge from this period . The genre has been less popular since the emergence of 3D-based mass-market games , but still some beat 'em ups adapted the simple formula to utilize large-scale 3D environments . In recent years , the genre has seen a resurgence in Asia , with the success of South Korean online beat 'em up Dungeon Fighter Online ( 2004 ) .
